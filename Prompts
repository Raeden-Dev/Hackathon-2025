Propmts :

We are building a closed-campus social media and utility app for ULAB students that connects to the URMS database and enhances student life, communication, and safety. The app is exclusive to verified ULAB students, with profiles populated via URMS (basic student info, courses, etc.). The app will help students feel more connected, solve common campus problems, and streamline day-to-day tasks.

üí° Core Features & How They Work:

Class Schedule Sync & Smart Match

Students import their class schedules from URMS.

The app intelligently matches timetables between friends (only visible to accepted friends).

The system analyzes all class schedules to list available vacant classrooms, labs, and seminar rooms in real time ‚Äî critical for finding space when the cafeteria/library is full.

Club Management & Discovery

Students can view, join, or leave clubs with a tap.

Club profiles show activities, events, and member lists to promote transparency.

Campus Proximity & Location Sharing

Live friend location sharing (within campus only), visible only to friends.

Privacy toggles allow users to turn it off anytime.

Emergency Section

A dedicated space for emergency contacts, mass SOS alerting, and coordination during crises.

Includes real-time location sharing and quick-response tools.

Events & Announcements (Official Only)

Clubs, faculty, and university staff can post official event cards.

Events include RSVP, reminders, and integration with personal calendar.

Regular students cannot post here to maintain a formal space.

Complaint Box & Moderation

Digital complaint form to report issues to university authorities.

Moderated by a verified panel of faculty/admin.

Smart Messaging System

Private chats between friends.

Group chats auto-created for each course section, club, or campus event.

Filters and notification settings to reduce noise.

Campus Entry Security (Face-ID + QR)

At the front gate, students scan their ID QR.

A camera system captures their face in real-time and matches it with the URMS photo.

If matched, a green tick is shown; otherwise, a red cross appears.

All entries are logged with photo data for future verification if needed.

Social Feed + Friend System

Users can send/accept friend requests.

A personal feed shows activity, events, and updates from friends & clubs.
